//! Sudoku puzzle solver and generator library.
//!
//! Sudokugen can find a solution to a valid puzzle using a mixture of basic strategies
//! and brute force. It can also generate new minimal puzzles.
//! This library was built as a rust learning project for myself.
//!
//! # How to use Sudokugen
//! Sudokugen uses two structures to parse, manipulate and display a sudoku, a board and puzzle.
//! The [Board] structure allows you to parse a board from a string, display it and try to solve it.
//! The [Puzzle] structure contains the information relevant for a new puzzle, the initial board and it's solution.
//!
//! You can parse a board from a string:
//!
//! ```
//! use sudokugen::Board;
//!
//! let board: Board = "
//!      . . . | 4 . . | 8 7 .
//!      4 . 3 | . . . | . . .
//!      2 . . | . . 3 | . . 9
//!      ---------------------
//!      . . 6 | 2 . . | . . 7
//!      . . . | 9 . 6 | . . .
//!      3 . 9 | . 8 . | . . .
//!      ---------------------
//!      . . . | . . . | . 4 .
//!      8 7 2 | 5 . . | . . .
//!      . . . | 7 2 . | 6 . .
//! ".parse().unwrap();
//! ```
//! After it's parsed you can solve it using the [Board::solve] function:
//! ```
//! # use sudokugen::Board;
//! #
//! # let mut board: Board =
//! #    ". . . | 4 . . | 8 7 .
//! #     4 . 3 | . . . | . . .
//! #     2 . . | . . 3 | . . 9
//! #     ---------------------
//! #     . . 6 | 2 . . | . . 7
//! #     . . . | 9 . 6 | . . .
//! #     3 . 9 | . 8 . | . . .
//! #     ---------------------
//! #     . . . | . . . | . 4 .
//! #     8 7 2 | 5 . . | . . .
//! #     . . . | 7 2 . | 6 . .
//! #    "
//! #       .parse()
//! #       .unwrap();
//! #
//! board.solve().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(
//!     board,
//!     "695412873413879526287653419146235987728946135359187264561398742872564391934721658"
//!     .parse()
//!     .unwrap()
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! Finally you can generate new puzzles using [Puzzle::generate], when doing this you must specify what size of puzzle
//! do you want to generate, [BoardSize] makes that easy.
//!
//! ```
//! use sudokugen::{Puzzle, BoardSize};
//!
//! let puzzle = Puzzle::generate(BoardSize::NineByNine);
//!
//! println!("Puzzle\n{}", puzzle.board());
//! println!("Solution\n{}", puzzle.solution());
//! ```
//! Which will print something like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! > Puzzle
//! > . . . . . . . 6 .
//! > . 1 7 . 4 . . 9 .
//! > . . . . 9 . 5 3 .
//! > . . 5 . 7 2 8 . .
//! > 1 . . . . 8 4 5 .
//! > . 4 . 9 . . . . .
//! > 8 7 9 1 2 . . . .
//! > 4 5 . 8 . . . . .
//! > . . . . . . . . .
//! >
//! > Solution
//! > 9 2 3 5 8 1 7 6 4
//! > 5 1 7 6 4 3 2 9 8
//! > 6 8 4 2 9 7 5 3 1
//! > 3 6 5 4 7 2 8 1 9
//! > 1 9 2 3 6 8 4 5 7
//! > 7 4 8 9 1 5 6 2 3
//! > 8 7 9 1 2 6 3 4 5
//! > 4 5 6 8 3 9 1 7 2
//! > 2 3 1 7 5 4 9 8 6
//! ```
//!
//! # Crate Layout
//! This crate is divided in three modules. [`board`] contains the tools needed to parse, manipulate and print
//! a puzzle and its individual cells. [`solver`] extends [`board::Board`] with the [`board::Board::solve`] function and [`solver::generator`] contains
//! the [Puzzle] structure and it's static [`Puzzle::generate`] function.
//!
//! # Puzzle quality
//! Grading puzzles is beyond the scope of this crate. The reason behind it is that grading puzzles
//! correctly, requires solving them like a human would and some of the more complex techniques to solve
//! a puzzle like a human would require a lot of computations that do not always payoff performance-wise.
//!
//! That being said, the generated puzzles consistently have between 22 and 26 clues making them likely
//! on the harder side of most generally available puzzles.
//!
//! # Is it fast?
//! The quick answer is, it depends on your use case. The [`Board::solve`] function is optimized to be
//! decently fast for a 9x9 sudoku puzzle, in my 2017 MacBook Pro it takes an average of 300Î¼s
//! to solve a difficult puzzle, that is around 3000 puzzles per second.
//!
//! The [`Puzzle::generate`] function is less optimized and makes heavy usage of [`Board::solve`] without trying to
//! re-use repeated computations, as such it's much slower clocking at about 18ms to generate
//! a new puzzle in my benchmarks.
//!
//! You can run your own benchmarks with `cargo bench`
